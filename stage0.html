        <h1> Summary Notes </h1>
            <b> How the net works </b>
                <p> I go to a website say www.shoes.com (which is most likely in the <em> <b> HTML</b> </em> format), I input information that is sent to the 
                servers through <a href=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/HTTP.html <em><b>HTTP</b></em></a> and vise versa back to me. The end! I think. </p>
             <b>HTML</b>
                <p><b> HTML </b> stands for hypertext markup language. The hypertext is the text (duh), and markup basically describes the appearance of the text. </p>
            <b>Tags and Elements </b>
                <p>The text/image you would see on the HTML page is what is an element. The tag is what formats it, like making it bold etc. It would 
                    look something like this in the text editor &lt;tag&gt; Element &lt;tag&gt; </p>
                
                <em> The end. More later </em>
